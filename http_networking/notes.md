# HTTP

protocol for communicating online \
Requests and responses: we make requests as a client to a server  \
URL is not specific to HTTP. the prefix specifies the protocol

## clients and servers

clients exist on the front-end of an app (what the user sees) , the server exists at the back-end of an app. the **server** handles the HTTP request

## fetch API
set of built in functions to make HTTP request \
takes 2 inputs : URL and settings \
use **await** before fetch because it can take a while \


## Web addresses

DNS: domain name system : map human readable --> ip adresses \
1. resolve DNS: domain --> IP
2. use IP to make the request across the Internet \
