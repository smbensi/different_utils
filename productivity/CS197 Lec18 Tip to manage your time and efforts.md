# How do  I make short-term progress ?

> 2 pieces : **organization** and **effort**

## Organization

tool of choice: **project tracker** . It's a google document in which you specify the progress you've made, the challenges you're encountering and the next steps that you are tackling. 

Think of the project tracker as your journal or diary or a log. It can remind you of the progress that you're making, and the direction you're headed. Every entry in the project tracker is marked by the date. In addition, Bullet points are organized and in sufficient detail such that a search that a future version of your project team member will be able to understand. The project tracker often links to important reference documents including a related work document, a working manuscript document, and an experimental result report (such as a google sheet or a Weight and Biases table).

While the project tracker can be helpful even when you're working as an individual it is super helpful when working in a group. In particular everyone in the group can know what the other members of the group are working on.

### on organizing your readings

It helps to have a related word document where you can keep a list of all of the papers you are reading. What makes a paper relevant is that it might be the work that you're building on in terms of methodology or following in terms of the experimental setup or using as the dataset for your work.
Finding important papers is a continuous process so it's something that you should continue to come back to and iterate over time. 

## Effort

The ability to commit quality time to a project has been the most distinguishing feature of a successful outcome. Tool of choice is a *google calendar*. You can specify chunks of time that are dedicated to working on a project. A recurring weekly time reduces the overhead associated with planning.
