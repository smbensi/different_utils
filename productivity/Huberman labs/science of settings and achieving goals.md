neuroplasticity underlines all forms of learning it consists on the reorganization of the connections
in the brain.  
Key principle of neuroplasticity is **making errors** as a good thing
The scientific litterature tells us is whenever you try to learn something new if you make
an error, it feels frustrating but that mode of frustration actually cues up particular brain
areas to be more alert so on subsequent attempts to learn that thing we have a higher alert on
that thing 
**Errors** are an entrypoint for making the brain more plastic

## What should be the error rate to learn

**85% rule for optimal learning**   

neurocircuit is an ensemble of brain areas that when they are active give rise to a special behavior.

4 areas involved in goal setting and achieving goal:
- anxiety and fear
- emotion
- planning and thinking across different time-scale
- go/no-go action

Value info \
Action : which action to take or not given the value

The neuro-modulator **dopamine** governs our goal setting, goal assesment, and goal pursuit
