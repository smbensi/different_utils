## vec => seq

given one vector as input I get a sequence of vectors as output \
*example:  image captionning* 

## seq ==> vec

*sentiment analysis*

## seq ==> vec ==> seq
 {x[t]} -> h -> {y[t]}
 you collapse the time and the temporal info is converted in descriptive info and then converted back to temporal info.\
 *example: translation*

## seq ==> seq
{x[t]} => {y[t]}

# RNN training
Back propagation through time (BPTT)
