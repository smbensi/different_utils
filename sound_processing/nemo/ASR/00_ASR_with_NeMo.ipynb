    "**Automatic Speech Recognition**, refers to the problem of getting a program to automatically transcribe spoken language (speech-to-text). Our goal is usually to have a model that minimizes the **Word Error Rate (WER)** metric when transcribing speech input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional speech recognition takes a generative approach, modeling the full pipeline of how speech sounds are produced in order to evaluate a speech sample. We would start from a **language model** that encapsulates the most likely orderings of words that are generated (e.g an n-gram model), to a **pronunciation model** for each word in that ordering (e.g. a pronunciation table), to an **acoustic model** that translates those pronunciations to audio waveforms (e.g. a gaussian mixture model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if we receive some spoken input, our goal would be to find the most likely sequence of text that would result in the given audio  according to our generative pipeline of models. Overall, with traditional speech recognition, we try to model `Pr(audio|transcript)*Pr(transcript)`, and take the argmax of this over the possible transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the appeal of **End-To-End ASR architectures**: discriminative models that simply take the audio input and give a textual output, andf in which all the components are trained together towards the same goal. The model's encoder would be akin to an acoustic model for extracting speech features, which can then be directly piped to a decoder which output texts. If desired, we could integrate a language model that would improve our predictions.\n",
