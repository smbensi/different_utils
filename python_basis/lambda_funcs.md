the identity function:
```python
def identity(x):
    return x
```
python `lambda` construction:
```python
lambda x: x
```
the expression is composed of:

-  the keyword: lambda
- a bound variable: x --> argument to a lambda function
- a body: x

free variable: not bound and may be referenced in the body of the expression. can be a constant of a variable defined in the enclosing scope of the function

apply a function to an argument:
```python
(lambda x: x+1)(2)  # -->3
add_one = lambda x: x+1
add_one(2) # -->3

full_name = lambda first, last: f"Full name: {first.title()} {last.title()}"
```
calling the lambda function is done exactly like a normal Python function

## Anonymous function

It's a function without a name. Created with the lambda keyword.

Lambda functions are frequently used with higher-order functions, which take one or more functions as arguments or return one or more functions.
A lambda function can be a higher-order function by taking a function as an argument
```python
high_ord_func = lambda x, func: x+func(x)
high_ord_func(2, lambda x: x*x)  # --> 6
```

## Functions
The `dis` module exposes functions to analyze Python bytecode generated by the python compiler. expose a readable version of the Python bytecode allowing the inspection of the low-level instructions that the Python interpreter will use while executing the program

Bytecode for lambda and func is the same juste the name is different: name defined in def fro the regular and lambda for the lambda
